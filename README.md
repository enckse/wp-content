WordPress content

## upfront

Because WordPress is toolbox of very sharp, frustrating, and obnoxious tools
(and plugins, all with a "Pro" edition to do _anything_ of use) - these are
some useful plugins/tools/utilities to not have to "buy in" deeper.

## plugins

the plugins directory contains plugins of interest that can be deployed (as
zips) to a WordPress site

### hphp

The "Happy Paws Haven Plugin" powers some very basic dynamic content handling
around inlining administrative numbers without asking everyone to hand edit
HTML and/or get some basic sum of counter values as well.

This is currently deployed for [Happy Paws Haven](https://happypawshaven.pet)

See [usage](/plugins/hphp/README.md) for more
